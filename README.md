# Hangman

# Description
This is the classic hangman game where you have to guess a particular word, movie or another category. For each incorrect letter the player guesses the hangman is drawn and the player loses once the hangman is completed (10 moves). For each correct letter the player guesses the blank in the word is changed to represent the correct letter to help the player continue to guess the word.
